# AgentShip demo

A small, **forkable** app built on [AgentShip](../agentship) that shows every
feature shipped so far. One runnable slice per feature, one live test per slice, and
a single `make demo` that runs them all and prints a real result for each.

**This demo is LIVE.** It needs a real API key and calls OpenAI for real, so it costs
a little each time you run it. No fakes, no echo stand-ins, no saved recordings, no
offline models — every slice and every test makes a real call to the OpenAI API.

New slices arrive one per phase as the framework ships each feature.

---

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Copy the credentials template and fill in your key
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env and set: OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# 2. Create a virtual env and install dependencies
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt   # or: make install

# 3. Run every slice live
make demo
```

---

## What this demo shows

Six live slices, one per shipped capability. Each slice is an agent spec under
`agents/` with a corresponding live test under `tests/`. `make demo` runs all six
top to bottom.

| # | Phase | Feature | Agent spec | Run just this slice |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | P01 | **`template: single`** — zero author code; one real `gpt-4o-mini` turn | `agents/assistant.yaml` | `pytest tests/test_smoke.py -q` |
| 2 | P01 | **Streaming** — real token-by-token stream; >1 chunk arrives live | `agents/streaming.yaml` | `pytest tests/test_streaming.py -q` |
| 3 | P01 | **`template: graph`** — supervisor scaffold; coordinator routes → worker answers | `agents/graph.yaml` | `pytest tests/test_graph.py -q` |
| 4 | P01 | **Custom `build_graph`** — the author's own native LangGraph graph answers | `agents/custom/custom.yaml` | `pytest tests/test_custom.py -q` |
| 5 | P01 | **`ModelRouter`** — router picks the model id, then a real turn runs | _(spec built inline)_ | `pytest tests/test_router.py -q` |
| 6 | P02 | **Durable multi-agent supervisor** — classify → route to a specialist → resolve; **resume token minted** (kill -9 would resume identically) | `agents/triage/triage.yaml` | `pytest tests/test_triage.py -q` |

> **Prerequisite for tests:** source your `.env` first so `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set.
> Without a key every test skips cleanly — it never fake-passes and never hard-errors.

## Running each slice

### 1 — `template: single`

```bash
agentship run agents/assistant.yaml --input "Give one productivity tip in one short sentence."
# or via make:
make run INPUT="Give one productivity tip."
```

Expected output: a short, non-empty tip from `gpt-4o-mini`.

### 2 — Streaming

```bash
agentship run agents/streaming.yaml --input "Name the 8 planets, comma-separated." --stream
```

Expected output: tokens arrive one by one, then the fully reassembled answer.

### 3 — `template: graph` (supervisor scaffold)

```bash
agentship run agents/graph.yaml --input "Help me plan a weekend trip to the mountains."
```

Expected output: the coordinator routes the request to a worker specialist and the
worker answers. **This is the authoring scaffold.** The full durable multi-agent
runtime (checkpoints, resume, retry, HITL) is slice 6.

### 4 — Custom `build_graph`

```bash
# Run from the demo repo root so the repo-root-relative code: path resolves
agentship run agents/custom/custom.yaml --input "Name three primary colors."
```

Expected output: the *author's* own LangGraph graph (not a template) answers. Shows
that a `code:` factory hands full control to the author — the harness just wires the
model and drives `run`/`stream`.

### 5 — `ModelRouter`

The router slice is exercised via `make demo` or its test (no standalone YAML for
this one — the spec is built in the demo runner directly):

```bash
pytest tests/test_router.py -q
```

Expected output: the `DefaultModelRouter` picks `openai/gpt-4o-mini`, then a real
turn through that model answers. The default router is a simple pass-through today;
the full lookup router (tier → model table) lands in Phase 03.

### 6 — Durable multi-agent supervisor (Phase 02)

```bash
# Run from the demo repo root so the repo-root-relative code: path resolves
agentship run agents/triage/triage.yaml \
  --input "My invoice looks wrong and I was double charged — who handles payments?"
```

Expected output:
- The supervisor classifies the request as `billing`.
- Routes to the billing specialist.
- Resolves the answer and prints it.
- A **resume token** is minted: `resume_token.engine = "langgraph"`.

What this proves end-to-end (Phase 02):
- **Multi-agent** (C1): classify → route → dispatch fan-out → resolve.
- **Durable checkpoints** (C4): the run is checkpointed per node via LangGraph's
  `AsyncPostgresSaver` (or in-memory for dev); a process kill mid-run resumes
  identically from the checkpoint.
- **Bounded retry** (C6): retryable specialist failures are retried up to the configured cap.
- **Dispatch strategies** (C7): `first-wins`, `all`, `fastest` — `first-wins` is the triage default.
- **Thread locking** (C8): exactly one worker can hold a thread at a time (`ThreadBusyError` on contention).

Run its live test:

```bash
set -a; source ../agentship/.env; set +a
pytest tests/test_triage.py -q -s    # -s to see the printed output
```

## Run all slices at once

```bash
make demo
```

This runs all six slices in order, prints a labeled block for each, and exits
non-zero if any slice fails — it is a real integration gate. The streaming slice
prints tokens as they arrive. Example output:

```
========================================================================
  [1] template: single (real gpt-4o-mini)
      LIVE · real answer · zero author code
========================================================================
  -> Batch similar tasks together to reduce context-switching.

========================================================================
  [6] durable multi-agent supervisor (Phase 02 killer demo)
      LIVE · classifies, routes to a specialist, resolves — durable (resume token minted)
========================================================================
  -> Our billing team handles payment issues. They can review your invoice ...
  durable: resume_token minted by 'langgraph' (kill -9 would resume)

DEMO OK — every capability ran LIVE against OpenAI.
```

---

## Run all tests

```bash
set -a; source ../agentship/.env; set +a
pytest -q        # or: make test
```

All six tests call OpenAI live. Without a key they skip; they never fake-pass.

## Authoring options

The slices exercise AgentShip's three authoring paths:

- **`template: single`** — zero author code (slice 1, `assistant.yaml`).
- **`template: graph`** — fillable multi-agent supervisor scaffold (slice 3).
- **Custom `build_graph`** — full control: subclass `LangGraphAgent`, write native
  LangGraph in `build_graph(model, tools)`, reference via `code:`. The harness wires
  the model and drives `run`/`stream`; the author never touches a vendor SDK
  (slices 4 and 6).

## Install

### Now (dev mode — editable-local)

AgentShip is not on PyPI yet; install the framework editable from the sibling monorepo
checkout. This repo expects the framework at `../agentship`.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
# or, equivalently:
make install
```

### Later (pinned pip — once AgentShip is published)

```bash
pip install "agentship[starter]==0.0.1"
```

When that works the editable-local step and the sibling-checkout step in CI go away.
